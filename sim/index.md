# About This Directory

For better organization, we keep all simulation files within the `/sim` directory. There is a separate document provided to you for the setup. Please use that.

# Quick Simulation

Assuming you have `questasim` or `modelsim` setup you can just open the simulation tool and source the `tcl` script.

```tcl
source ../tcl/adder_test.tcl 
```
